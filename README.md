Setting up Required Libraries:
----------------------------------------

ReinforcementScheduler requires iCal4j and its dependencies. Instructions for download can be found here: http://wiki.modularity.net.au/ical4j/index.php?title=Tutorial.

Download the binary archive and extract it to the root directory of ReinforcementScheduler. The file `needed-libraries.classpath' has the locations of the relevant jars. If you are using Eclipse to run this project, simply replace Eclipse's default `.classpath' file with `needed-libraries.classpath'.

To verify that your ReinforcementScheduler can use these libraries, run iCalPraser.iCalParserTest.scala
